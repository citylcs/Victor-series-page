    <h1>2. Speed is slow?</h1>
    <p>When installing the VPN profile file to your phone, Victor automatically selects a server with optimum speed. But the default server may not suit for your network all the time. In this case, you can try to switch to another server and reconnect.</p>
    <p>Due to the iOs system requirements, you need to reinstall the VPN profile everytime after changing server.</p>
